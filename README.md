Overview

The Quantum Drift Nexus (QDN) is a next-generation architecture for autonomous, self-sustaining hybrid computational systems.
This project introduces a novel approach to quantum computing by reframing quantum noise as a computational resource rather than an obstacle.
The architecture unifies energy harvesting, adaptive computation, and holographic information encoding into a closed-loop system designed for resilience and scalability.

Core Innovations

QDN integrates four foundational principles:

Self-Sustaining Energy Generation
Thermal rectification using graphene and metamaterials harvests ambient energy.

Noise-Adaptive Computation
Hybrid quantum-classical stack with biologically inspired modules that adaptively route computation through noisy environments.

Holographic Data Encoding
Non-local encoding across braided entanglement networks for inherent error resistance.

Unified Waveform Continuum
Treats energy, computation, and data as a single waveform, enabling seamless system-wide coherence maintained by continuous feedback control.

Key Performance Metrics

Early simulations (Qiskit-based) demonstrate measurable resilience improvements:

Simulation Task	Baseline Fidelity	QDN Fidelity	Improvement
Bell State	0.936	0.978	+4.5%
QFT	0.843	0.913	+8.3%
Grover Search	0.792	0.885	+11.7%

Note: Results based on 1024 shots with correlated noise models. Code and notebooks provided in the simulations/ folder ensure reproducibility.

Installation
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/leenathomas01/Quantum-Drift-Nexus.git
cd Quantum-Drift-Nexus

# Install dependencies
pip install -r simulations/requirements.txt

Running Basic Simulations
# Example of running a QDN noise-adaptive circuit
from simulations.qdn_qiskit_example import create_qdn_circuit, run_with_noise

# Create a 2-qubit QDN circuit
qdn_circuit = create_qdn_circuit(num_qubits=2, noise_level=0.05)

# Run with and without QDN adaptive correction
results = run_with_noise(qdn_circuit)

print(f"QDN Fidelity: {results['qdn_fidelity']}")

Roadmap

Phase I (Current): Qiskit/Cirq simulations with noise models (2–5 qubits)

Phase II: Extend to 7–10 qubits, exploring complex correlated noise

Phase III: Integrate reinforcement-learning-based noise management

Phase IV: Explore feasibility of graphene-based rectification prototypes

Phase V: Investigate distributed deployment with quantum-secure communication
