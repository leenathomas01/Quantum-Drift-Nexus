# Quantum Drift Nexus (QDN)

![QDN Architecture](diagrams/qdn_architecture.png)

## Overview

The Quantum Drift Nexus (QDN) is a next-generation architecture for autonomous, self-sustaining hybrid computational systems. This project introduces a radical new approach to quantum computing by **reframing quantum noise as a computational resource** rather than an obstacle.

## Core Innovations

QDN unifies three paradigms:

1. **Self-Sustaining Energy Generation**: Thermal rectification using graphene and metamaterials harvests ambient energy
2. **Adaptive Computation**: Hybrid quantum-bio-classical stack performs resilient computation in noisy environments
3. **Holographic Data Encoding**: Non-local data encoding across the system for error resistance

## Key Performance Metrics

Early simulations show significant improvements in quantum operation fidelity:

| Simulation Task | Baseline Fidelity | QDN Fidelity | Improvement |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Bell State      | 0.936             | 0.978        | +4.5%       |
| QFT             | 0.843             | 0.913        | +8.3%       |
| Grover Search   | 0.792             | 0.885        | +11.7%      |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Qiskit 0.42.0+
- NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/leenathomas01/Quantum-Drift-Nexus.git
cd Quantum-Drift-Nexus

# Install dependencies
pip install -r simulations/requirements.txt
```

### Running Basic Simulations

```python
# Example of running a QDN noise-adaptive circuit
from simulations.qdn_qiskit_example import create_qdn_circuit, run_with_noise

# Create a 2-qubit QDN circuit
qdn_circuit = create_qdn_circuit(num_qubits=2, noise_level=0.05)

# Run the circuit with and without QDN adaptive correction
results = run_with_noise(qdn_circuit)
print(f"Baseline Fidelity: {results['baseline_fidelity']}")
print(f"QDN Fidelity: {results['qdn_fidelity']}")
```

## Roadmap

1. **Phase I (Completed):** Simulations using Cirq/Qiskit with noise models (2-5 qubits)
2. **Phase II (Current):** Scaling QDN to 7-10 qubits with Redundant Logical Lattices (RLL); metrics in `/metrics`
3. **Phase III:** Integrate reinforcement learning-based noise management
4. **Phase IV:** Prototype physical units with graphene rectification
5. **Phase V:** Distributed deployment with quantum-secure communication
