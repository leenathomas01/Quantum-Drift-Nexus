**Overview**

The Quantum Drift Nexus (QDN) is a next-generation architecture for autonomous, self-sustaining hybrid computational systems.
This project introduces a novel approach to quantum computing by **reframing quantum noise as a computational resource** rather than an obstacle.
The architecture unifies energy harvesting, adaptive computation, and holographic information encoding into a closed-loop system designed for resilience and scalability.

**Core Innovations**

QDN integrates four foundational principles:

1. Self-Sustaining Energy Generation
Thermal rectification using graphene and metamaterials harvests ambient energy.

2. Noise-Adaptive Computation
Hybrid quantum-classical stack with biologically inspired modules that adaptively route computation through noisy environments.

3. Holographic Data Encoding
Non-local encoding across braided entanglement networks for inherent error resistance.

4. Unified Waveform Continuum
Treats energy, computation, and data as a single waveform, enabling seamless system-wide coherence maintained by continuous feedback control.

**Key Performance Metrics**

Early simulations (Qiskit-based) demonstrate measurable resilience improvements:

Simulation Task	Baseline Fidelity	QDN Fidelity	Improvement
Bell State	0.936	0.978	+4.5%
QFT	0.843	0.913	+8.3%
Grover Search	0.792	0.885	+11.7%

Note: Results based on 1024 shots with correlated noise models. Code and notebooks provided in the simulations/ folder ensure reproducibility.

**Getting Started
Prerequisites**

Python 3.8+

Qiskit 0.42.0+

NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy

**Installation**

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/leenathomas01/Quantum-Drift-Nexus.git
cd Quantum-Drift-Nexus

# Install dependencies
pip install -r simulations/requirements.txt

**Running Basic Simulations**

# Example of running a QDN noise-adaptive circuit
from simulations.qdn_qiskit_example import create_qdn_circuit, run_with_noise

# Create a 2-qubit QDN circuit
qdn_circuit = create_qdn_circuit(num_qubits=2, noise_level=0.05)

# Run with and without QDN adaptive correction
results = run_with_noise(qdn_circuit)
print(f"Baseline Fidelity: {results['baseline_fidelity']}")
print(f"QDN Fidelity: {results['qdn_fidelity']}")

**Roadmap**

**1. Phase I (Current):** Qiskit/Cirq simulations with noise models (2–5 qubits)

**2. Phase II:** Extend to 7–10 qubits, exploring complex correlated noise

**3. Phase III:** Integrate reinforcement-learning-based noise management

**4. Phase IV:** Explore feasibility of graphene-based rectification prototypes

**5. Phase V:** Investigate distributed deployment with quantum-secure communication
